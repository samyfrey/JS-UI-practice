As identifier of the HTML elements,  I use data attributes for elements that will be used by Javascript to differentiate with class for elements that will be used by CSS 

To select data attributes in JS, needs to use brackets in query selector

JS functions
parseFloat() : returns a number from a string or NaN
isNan() : returns true if given value is Nan otherwise, false


Logic:
need to know the previous operand if any, the operation selected and the current operand
